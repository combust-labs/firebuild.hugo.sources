## Install git

`firebuild` source code is hosted on GitHub. You need `git` installed on the machine where `firebuild` is built. The build system must be a Linux host.

**For example**, to install `git` on Ubuntu, execute:

```sh
sudo apt-get install git-core -y
```

To install on a different operating system, follow the instructions specific to that system.
